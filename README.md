# Home Appliances Control Project  

**Course:** CSE211: Introduction to Embedded Systems  
**Institution:** Ain Shams University - Faculty of Engineering  

## Project Overview  
This project showcases a laptop-based home automation system powered by the TM4C123GH6PM microcontroller. The system enables users to control and monitor various home appliances through a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI).  

## Features  
- **Lamp Control:**  
  - Toggle a 220V lamp on/off while maintaining manual switch functionality.  

- **Plug Control:**  
  - Enable or disable plug usage to ensure safety.  

- **Door Status Display:**  
  - Monitor door status (open/closed) using a limit switch.  

- **Temperature Monitoring:**  
  - Display real-time room temperature and trigger alarms when the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold.  

- **Door Logs:**  
  - Record and display timestamps of door open/close events.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Microcontroller:** TM4C123GH6PM  
- **Programming Languages:**  
  - C (embedded systems)  
  - Java (GUI development)  
- **Software Tools:**  
  - IAR Embedded Workbench  
  - IntelliJ IDEA  
- **Hardware Components:**  
  - Limit switch  
  - Temperature sensor  
  - Relays  

## Project Highlights
